What challenges did you face, and how did you overcome them?
I was challenged with my main.py in my first project not uploading anything; it was unavailable and doesn't respond to any of my changes. I solved this through making a new project with the same outline and it worked, this is what I used to answer and finish this FA 3.3.
 
How can cloud hosting make your project more useful to others?
Cloud hpsting can make our project more useful to others by making it accesible, scalable and more collaborative; it also helps efficient coding from different computers instead of using one.
